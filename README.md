osvdb-touch
===========

A basic Sencha Touch app I made to compile as a Playbook/BB10 app. This simple app has a few tabs with RSS feeds of new vulnerabilities posted to OSVDB as well as the @OSVDB twitter feed. Essentially I used this as a quick exercise to play with Sencha Touch and the WebWorks SDK (as well as get a free Playbook during a promotion they were having).

This app requires the [Sencha Touch SDK](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/download/) in order to work. Download the SDK and place <code>sencha-touch.js</code> and <code>sencha-touch.css</code> in the same directory as <code>index.js</code>.

You can try the app out by opening <code>index.html</code> in a WebKit browser. If you wish to build it for the Playbook, you can package the files using [Ripple](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/packaging_your_app_in_ripple_1904611_11.html), which is what I used to create the WebWorks app and submit it to the AppWorld.
